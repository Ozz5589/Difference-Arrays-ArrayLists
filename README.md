# Difference-Arrays-ArrayLists

This demonstrates the differences between arrays and ArrayLists in Java.

## Project Structure

- DifferencesExample.java: Contains the main method where arrays and ArrayLists are demonstrated.

## Code Explanation:

1. Arrays:
   - Fixed size: Size needs to be declared at creation.
   - Use a simple `for` loop for assigning and accessing values.
   - Once declared, you cannot change the size of the array.

2. ArrayLists:
   - Dynamic size: Can grow and shrink as needed.
   - Provides built-in methods to manipulate data (`add()`, `remove()`, etc.).
   - Using a loop to iterate and access elements is straightforward but different from arrays.
